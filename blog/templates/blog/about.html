            Welcome to MyBlog
             My little corner of the internet where I share all the fun (and chaos ðŸ˜…) that comes with learning full stack web development.
            
            Iâ€™m a curious coder, web dev intern, and big fan of turning coffee into code â˜•ðŸ’». Here youâ€™ll find snippets of my journey, projects Iâ€™m working on, helpful tutorials, and honest thoughts from a fresher figuring things out one bug at a time.
            
            If youâ€™re learning too, or just love all things web, I hope you feel right at home here ðŸ’›</h1>
    </div>
